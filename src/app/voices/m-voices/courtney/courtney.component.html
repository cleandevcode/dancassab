          An east coast native who planted roots in Los Angeles 13 years ago,
          Courtney began her career navigating the waves of LA&#x2019;s fashion
          opportunities. After realizing her calling was a deeper, more
          personalized service beyond the boundaries of retail and styling, she
          created her own path. Initially conceived as a blog, &#8220;Always
          Judging&#8221; is now a trusted inspiration source for all things
          fashion, vintage, music, and interiors, an intimate lens and window
          into Courtney&#x2019;s world. Beyond this, the AJ audience relies on
          her unfiltered approach across self-care, wellness, and transparency
          in her product reviews, all to advocate a healthier lifestyle that
          contributes to the journey of happiness and wellbeing.

          Through the years, what also remains constant on Courtney&#x2019;s
          platform is her contagious curiosity and appetite for welcoming
          challenges head-on. Whether it&#x2019;s exploring her personal style,
          searching to the ends of the Earth for a piece of vintage furniture,
          or perfecting the science behind her latest venture,
          &#8220;Stevie&quot;, the same amount of tenacity and heart is palpable

          I grew up in Pittsburgh, PA and never felt I really fit in. My friends
          were cool, and I had fun in high school, but I was more interested in
          working in a shop and styling looks for school the night before. I
          remember getting excited about my looks as young as three years old.
          One time, in pre-school I insisted on wearing an 80s polka dot dress
          five times in a row. My mom was so embarrassed. Styling all my friends
          in high school as a hobby then ended up turning into a full-blown
          career.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first year out of high school was spent in NYC going to LIM
          (Laboratory Institute of Merchandising), then decided I never wanted
          to live in snow ever again in my life, so I moved to LA and attended
          FIDM (Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising). I fucked around in
          college, I partied a LOT&#x02026;I almost wasn&#x2019;t even
          interested in fashion anymore until I graduated and got a job at
          Intermix where I rediscovered how much I loved styling and helping
          people find something that made them feel powerful and good about
          themselves. After three years at Intermix, I worked at four other
          different retailers in LA, did wholesale for a bit, was a buyer, and
          then started my blog at 26. It took off right away and I think because
          of how much experience I had accumulated in every area of fashion, and
          the one thing I&#x2019;ve always been really good at is helping
          people&#x02026;finding something that makes them feel empowered and
          good about themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blogging has been the most successful business for me and it comes
          naturally. The thing I try to maintain is transparency and
          authenticity among my followers. I&#x2019;m not perfect, I&#x2019;m a
          human being and I fuck up. But, I&#x2019;m transparent in sharing all
          experiences good and bad with the internet and ironically, I
          don&#x2019;t do it to judge, I do it because I love sharing and I hope
          that inspires people to be themselves and not care what anyone else
          thinks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, weed: I&#x2019;ve been a pothead my whole life, and I
          don&#x2019;t think everyone who smokes weed is a pothead, but I smoke
          a LOT, so that I AM. It helps motivate me. It makes me creative and
          relieves my anxiety, helps me gain appetite, so many positive things.
          My dad was in the weed biz illegally my whole life, and now here I am
          doing it legally. I started Stevie, a CBD brand, to try and fill a gap
          between fashion and negative stigmas behind cannabis. Cannabis and CBD
          are not bad for you. In fact, they promote a more natural way to ease
          pain, anxiety, along with so many other benefits. It shouldn&#x2019;t
          be frowned upon. So, I decided to start Stevie for my stressed-out
          friends in fashion. After two years of working on it, Stevie launched
          on March 7th this year. Right now, I&#x2019;m working on the launch of
          more CBD products while still working on fashion jobs remotely from
          LA. For the last six consecutive years I&#x2019;ve spent more time on
          planes - every other week, Europe every month - and then COVID hit and
          it all stopped. Stevie kind of saved my ass financially because
          we&#x2019;ve had such a great response in sales and return customers,
          feedback, all of it.

          Fashion needed CBD! Everyone is stressed out all the time. This is
          missing in the market. I don&#x2019;t see anyone doing anything
          original in cannabis speaking to the fashion community. So, I decided
          that person had to be me.

          EVERYTHING. Literally, everything, because it&#x2019;s tricky.
          It&#x2019;s tricky because you have a community of people who may have
          some weird taboo feelings toward cannabis, and they&#x2019;re pretty
          skeptical- this means they&#x2019;ll be looking for a product that
          they can 100% see results from - so GOOD product. This community of
          people is also heavily influenced by branding and messaging. Cult
          brands do well amongst this audience and to establish a following, you
          need to create a world everyone wants to be part of. You need to make
          sure the world is attainable but through the process of discovery.
          Friendly but not desperate. That&#x2019;s why everything from the
          branding to the product had to be prioritized. I wanted customers to
          feel like Stevie is this imaginary goddess who is guiding them through
          their CBD journey - almost like a guru or doctor. Stevie the goddess
          is the symbol for our CBD. Up to something is our one-liner because
          people who are consuming Cannabis, specifically CBD, are high but they
          aren&#x2019;t high sitting around, they&#x2019;re high &
          they&#x2019;re also up to something! And they&#x2019;re up to
          something because cannabis and CBD are natural medicine being used as
          legal forms of healing in most U.S. states now. I really hope the
          negative connotation attached to weed is close to done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, considering the planet and environment as much as I could while
          choosing the materials and packaging were very important to me. I
          never thought of myself as being overly cautious about where I shop or
          which eco brands I buy into, but when it came to my own brand, and
          personally putting something out into the world when it came down to
          it, I consistently chose the more eco-option. It didn&#x2019;t feel
          right putting tons of plastic out into the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing that was really important to me and one of the reasons I
          laughed Hi Stevie is to fight the war on prescription drug abuse. I
          realize some people need prescription drugs and they are used for good
          at times, but in America so many people abuse them and get addicted to
          pain killers and end up having a very hard time weening themselves
          off. CBD is a more natural way to manage pain.

          I will stay DTC, that&#x2019;s always been the plan, but as so much of
          the fashion community is in Paris, it was really important I figured
          out how to sell in Paris. Season Paris is selling it at the restaurant
          in Marais. It&#x2019;s going really well there; Cathy is a good friend
          and I love her cafe. I want this brand to evolve into its own retail
          location with AT LEAST 50 different products. I eventually want my own
          cannabis farm and shop. Fashion will always be number one but without
          cannabis I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to do fashion, so they work hand in
          hand for me and my future. We have so many cool, insanely effective
          products coming out this year, STAY TUNED!

          You can’t argue that for everyone interested in the arts, it starts to
          take over every aspect of their lives. Furniture and vintage-inspired
          interiors are just a piece of the puzzle of being artistic and in
          fashion. Style and taste spills over into every aspect of my own life,
          including interiors. My creativity comes from my space and my
          surroundings reflect what I’m trying to say, so that is what drives my
          curiosity.

          and getting to know the way different people think and where
          they&#x2019;re from. It keeps me going. There are so many people in
          the world and I imagine how many special people are out there. I miss
          the excitement of meeting and talking with new people&#x02026;being
          stuck in LA is killing my soul.

          I&#x2019;ve learned that maybe the United States isn&#x2019;t for me,
          but I already knew that. I&#x2019;ve been mostly abroad for the last
          three years, and they were the best years of my life so far.
          I&#x2019;ve learned that fashion is really important to me and
          it&#x2019;s something that made me really, really happy and I miss all
          of it. I learned I&#x2019;m my most creative on mushrooms I also
          learned how much love my group of friends has for each other by the
          way people are keeping in touch from every side of the world.

          I like to daydream. I&#x2019;m a daydreamer, or you could say
          manifestor? I sit around a lot and try to picture what I want for
          myself for the near future. I don&#x2019;t like to think too far ahead
          because I&#x2019;m always changing my mind. You are who you hang out
          with, so I try and surround myself with people who make life less
          stressful. I smoke weed when I have actual anxiety. As far as
          everything else, I don&#x2019;t live in fear, I just do what makes me
          happy. If it doesn&#x2019;t it&#x2019;s gone.
